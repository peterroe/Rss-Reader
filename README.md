## Rss-Reader

A DeskTop rss-Reader app base on [tauri-app](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).

### Why tauri-app? 

ðŸ˜•For developing desktop applications, there are a number of frameworks to choose from, such as:

* [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron): chromium + Nodejs
* [neutralinojs](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs): webview + c++
* [Chromely](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely): CEF + .net
* [electrino](https://github.com/pojala/electrino): webview + .net
* [go-astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron): electron + go
* [wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails): webview + go

Although the usage of `electron` has been far aheadï¼Œbut it has been criticized for its huge size and memory usage during runtime.

âœŒAnd tauri-app is much better in this regard. It is only a few size after packaging, which is far better than electron. Although tauri-app is still in its infancy, due to the rich API and good performance at present , it is slightly better than other similar products.

You can see its trend [here](https://risingstars.js.org/2021/en). I believe it will become more complete in the future

### Why Rss-Reader?

ðŸ¤”As you can see, there are many [RSS products on the market](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/#inoreader), but most of them are in the form of Web sites, and you have to exchange your personal information for the permission to log in to the site (some people resent this behavior). 

Among the products of desktop programs, there are few products with beautiful interface and open source. I think it is best if the products on the user side can be free and open source without advertisements, and secondly, capable developers can also add their own ideas.

ðŸŽ‰This is why [Rss-Reader](https://github.com/peterroe/Rss-Reade) comes.
